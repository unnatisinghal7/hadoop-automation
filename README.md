# hadoop-automation

This script usually works on Desktop folder of the Linux distribution as all the paths are set accordingly.
We need to place the following folders with the specific names on the Desktop of the system-
-> jdk.rpm
Downlaod the rpm file of Java jdk and save it on desktop with above name.
-> hadoop.rpm
Downlaod the rpm file of Apache Hadoop and save it on desktop with above name.
-> hive.tar.gz
Downlaod the tar file of apache Hive containing rpm file and save it on desktop with above name.


The use of various packages are also done which needs to installed in the system before running the script-
-> paramiko
-> getpass
